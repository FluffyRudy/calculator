# calculator
A web-based calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for quick and easy calculations.


## Features

- **Custom Calculation Algorithm**: Unlike many web calculators, this project doesn't use the `eval()` function to perform calculations. Instead, it implements a custom algorithm that parses and calculates expressions. This approach avoids the potential security risks associated with `eval()` and demonstrates a deeper understanding of arithmetic operations.
- - Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Clear functionality to reset calculations.
- Responsive design that works on various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: Structuring the web page.
- CSS: Styling the calculator to make it user-friendly.
- JavaScript: Implementing calculator's logic
